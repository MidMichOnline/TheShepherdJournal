An article on *The Morning Sun* Facebook page announced that the newspaper is shutting down its "Sound Off" feature. This was the column which printed questions and comments from community members who would call into a phone line. I only paid attention to this news feature when (1) somebody else pointed out a really controversial comment; or (2) if I saw it on my newsfeed and was curious to find out what people were talking about. In a way the Sound Off was a strange throwback to a distant past when there wasn't social media, the Cloud, or maybe even the Internet. Perhaps in a way it kept the newspaper accessible to those who hadn't stayed up to date with technology. Now, I guess they will only have two choices: learn how to send an email, or write down their thoughts on paper and then mail it in. In describing the Sound Off's long history, Rick Mills said: 
> Our vision for Sound Off was to offer voice to the community, to extend a quick way to be heard and to give audience to those with messages that, for whatever reason, could only be shared anonymously. Sound Off has solved some problems, righted some wrongs, exposed some issues and led to stories that would not have been known or written if the whistle-blower were identified. Those were on its best days. On its worst days, Sound Off has been what one friend of ours called a train wreck: You feel guilty and you kind of donâ€™t want to look, but you just have to take a peek anyway.  He continued to talk about how anonymity contributed to some of the more snide comments. And, he said that the volume of calls had dwindled recently. Will you miss the Sound Off feature in the newspaper?
