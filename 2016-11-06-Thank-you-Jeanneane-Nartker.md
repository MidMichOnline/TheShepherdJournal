Thank you Jeanneane Nartker

Superintendent Claire Bunker:

I just want to give a community shout out and huge THANK YOU to Jeanneane Wood-Nartker for her work on making The Play Zone a reality. To put it simply Jeanneane believed in this project and would not give up until it happened.

Tomorrow at 8:30 am construction will begin on the "Play Zone". The Play Zone is a barrier free playground and will be located on the varsity baseball/softball field complex at Shepherd Schools. Jeanneane Wood-Nartker a CMU professor, community member, Shepherd parent and wife of long time baseball coach Jack Nartker, came up with the idea through a project in her CMU interior design class. It has taken several years but tomorrow instillation will begin. The entire project has been funded with donations. Jeanneane and many other have worked very hard to make this happen.

Here is a summary:

Shepherd Public Schools are planning to install a playground called "The Play Zone," adjacent to the boys' Varsity Baseball field and the girls’ Varsity Softball field at Shepherd High School. This playground will serve the children who attend these games, as well as local and visiting community members. The Play Zone will be the only inclusive playground in Shepherd and will provide play opportunities for community children, ages 2-12.

It will enable all children - including those with physical, developmental, cognitive and sensory disabilities – to experience accessible, independent, self-directed play and increased health/fitness, each at their own highest level of ability. Not only will it allow children with disabilities to participate, but it will enable children who do not have disabilities to play alongside those who do, building new relationships across all generations.

In addition to the playground, paths will be built to connect the playground to the community 3-mile walking path, the parking lot, and the restrooms at the adjacent concession's area. Shade canopies will be installed to protect children from sun hazards, along with foul balls from the ball fields.

The Play Zone will benefit the community of Shepherd, as well as children and parents from visiting communities who attend softball and baseball games. As stated above, the universal design of this playground will allow children of all abilities to play in a safe, accessible, barrier-free environment. This will promote relationship-building among children who may not interact much without this opportunity.

In addition, it will lay the foundation for collaboration with people from other communities, as children from surrounding areas are utilizing it during visits, away games, etc. Parents and grandparents may also participate as the playground is designed to enhance play among children with their adult caretakers. The playground will be connected to the 3-mile community path that will encourage other community members in to play and engage in this accessible playground.

Outstanding!
